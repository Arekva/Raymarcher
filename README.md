# Raymarcher
C# Engine based on OpenCL. Very WIP

# How to build project

- The project should not have any problem to build. If you have any problem, add OpenCL.Net from Nuget and it should be working.

- Copy the __content__ of the CL folder next to the built executable in order to make it compile the CL files.
